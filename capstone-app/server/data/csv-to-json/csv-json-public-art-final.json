    "artists_id": "3",
    "artists_names": "Ken Lum",
    "artist_statement": "Monument For East Vancouver develops from a graffiti symbol that has circulated for several decades in East Vancouver.  It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.  The sculpture faces westward towards downtown, towards the centre.  It is an expression of hope and defiance.",

Set into pavers, they are like markers on a path (of time), an echo.

The concept is based upon the mythical river Lethe, the river as a repository of memories. Once, only a stone's throw from this site, an ancient stream flowed down through a forest. It carried into the \"well\" of the sea the memories from earliest times.  I am proposing a symbolic reclamation of the past and recognition of change. ... there will be three elements within this flowing river. From the \"source\" at the upper waters a 10 ton erratic glacial boulder will be positioned ... at the pool below will be its mirror image, in bronze altered by chemical reaction and time. Language is the third bridging element, for words to convey a sense of a river's journey I have used the following quote by Leonardo da Vinci: \"In rivers, the water you touch is the last of what has passed, and the first of that which comes; so with time present.\"",

It is directed at those who operate our free-market economy in their own interests, while excluding those interests that would be 'responsive to the needs of the community'.  The subtext to \"Unlimited Growth ..\" relates to several aspects of public art including the need to address the use of site-specific work as a way of intervening in local issues, and in this instance, acting as a marker of resistance by the economically marginalized, as represented by a parallel gallery and a hotel providing affordable housing.    Walter raises questions related to the systems underlying the transactions and power-plays that constitute normal business in the world of real estate development. In Walter's art the museum without walls is also a museum OF walls, walls  new and old, as well as those walls that perpetuate economic class distinctions.  Her text on the faï¿½ade of the Del-Mar Hotel will stand as a witness to the various power-plays, including the threat to move B.C.

First, 40 tile mosaics spiral across the site in 16 brilliant colours. Each design has been abstracted from photo images of actual galaxies. Then clusters of stars are created by 160 fibre optic points of light set in granite tiles which in turn are joined by polished brass dashed lines to define familiar constellations. The granite has been designed and laid out in four shapes reflecting four different starlight intensities. Third, alluding to humankind's historical fascination with navigation of the heavens, four large bronze castings of ships, icons familiar to Vancouver's harbours, are set at each port or threshold of entry - a fishing trawler, a gravel barge and tug, and an 18-foot long ferry. Finally, the 40 colour fields of stone aggregate, which overlay and unite all the elements, are abstractions of colour maps made of the Milky Ways' \"cosmic sea.\" The recurring fours and forties and their multiples in the work refer to wholeness, totality, and completion (appropriate for a work completed at the end of the millennium).\" (From news release for public opening ceremony)",

The lights, which are at grade level, define constellations in the night sky. The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.      Kerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee. It has been integrated into the public plaza/walkway that runs diagonally through the site from the corner of Alberni and Broughton to the corner of Jervis and Georgia. The work addresses pedestrian traffic through the walkway both during the day and as a completely different experience at night. It also allows opportunities for viewing the work from above from suites in the towers and from neighbouring towers. \"Milky Way\" has four elements layered into the work. The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the \"cosmic sea\". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These \"stars\" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above. This work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony. \"Milky Way\" is a successful example of Vancouver's public art program which has emphasized \"site specific\" public art instead of traditional sculpture.",

The activity on the sea is represented by images of First Nations peoples and their canoes and Captain George Vancouver and his ship Discovery along with Valdes and Galiano and their ships Sutil and Mexicana from 1792.The image also shows Captain GH Richards who surveyed the area and his ship Plumber as well as the Beaver, the first steamship on the coast, a Hudson Bay Company supply vessel, along with others. In the diamond in the centre of the image is the Empress of Japan and its famous dragon figurehead which is in the Museum's collection.  Modern freighters and luxury steamers complete this section of the picture. The Lions Gate Bridge, built in 1939, is depicted, as is the St Roch, the RCMP patrol vessel that worked the North-West Passage in the early 1940s, which is housed in the Maritime Museum. Also shown are the Ivanhoe and the Master, wood-hulled tugs from the early 20th century.

The competition guidelines (1979) specified a sculpture made of permanent materials, \"not wood,\" and that it should not be in the likeness of a man. The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, \"The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast.\" The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice. Gordon Smith, a member of the selection panel, said that \"If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away.\"  It was originally to be sited at Ferguson Point in Stanley Park.",

The corten steel is designed so that the surface rust forms a protective coating.  There was some adverse reaction from Kits Point residents when the work was installed. Michael Duncan, Chief Curator of the Maritime Museum at the time, called it \"a bloody monstrosity.\" An article in the Globe and Mail teased that it could be \"the world's largest paper clip.\" The article (Mar3, 1981) also quoted from a city planning study which read: \"Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.\"  But the controversy soon abated and the piece has weathered time and opinion. It was vandalized on July 4th, 1988, when a field of white dots were painted on its surfaces -probably as an art \"intervention\". The dots were soon removed. Since then, the \"Gate to the Northwest Passage\" has become a familiar landmark, an important place marker which stands guard at the entrance to False Creek. The area around the site is a favorite for kite flyers.",

    "work_description": "A life size bronze statue of a woman in a wetsuit, with flippers on her feet and her mask pushed up on her forehead, sits on a large intertidal boulder just offshore of Stanley Park.   In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown's initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location.  Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. \"When I couldn't get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled   right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.\" A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci's foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 8o feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. \"Girl in Wetsuit\" has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.",

As part of the City's permanent collections, it was on view in Stanley Park from 1922 to 1986, when it was brought indoors by the Museum to prevent further decay. Preservation work was undertaken with support from the Bank of British Columbia, now a division of the Hong Kong Bank of Canada, through the Vancouver Legacies Program.

The word refined refers to both the process of removing unwanted elements to create an increasingly homogeneous and pure substance and also to the perception of characteristics such as elegance, sophistication, and urbanity. The artwork, Refined, draws specifically on the forms and processes of salt purification which used to take place in the building immediately proximal to the site while exploring the overall transformation of the neighbourhood itself. The artwork is composed of five pure-white, conical sculptures of varying heights that sit within a recessed pool of recycled glass. During the day, the pure geometric forms and angular shapes of the surrounding glass elements catch and play with natural sunlight. At night, warm hued lights, evocative of the colour of salt in its raw unrefined state, cast a glow onto the artwork surfaces.",

Oppenheimer was an entrepreneur from Germany and served four 1-year terms as Mayor. He donated land for city parks and for the Rogers sugar refinery. The memorial committee planned to hire Augustus St. Gaudens to build a memorial gate to connect Stanley Park to the City in honour of Oppenheimer but they found out St. Gaudens was dead.  Charles Marega was new to Vancouver and had his first exhibition here with the Studio Club in October of 1909, showing small wax figures. Art critic Felix Penne (Francis Bursill) wrote in Vancouver World, \"These have the right feeling and directness of life and there is every indication the sculptor is capable of broader and more ambitious work - which I shall be glad to see.  Soon Vancouver will not have to propose dead sculptors to design memorials - there are and will be living and capable sculptors nearer home than on the other bank of the Styx..\" The original budget for the project was $50,000, but by the time Marega was commissioned in 1910, the project had become a bust for $4500, of which Marega was paid $3600 and the balance paid for an elaborate unveiling ceremony.

    "artist_statement": "A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named.  Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting. An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley.  Matthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\" Townley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\". Matthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\" Townley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\" The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.",

The birth of the mechanical clock circa 1,000 AD was a technological innovation that, as Lewis Mumford pointed out in \"Technics and Civilization\" made possible the mechanical clock as a simile for his paradigm of the workings of nature, a paradigm cited in recent years as contributing to the world's current ecological state: hence the \"ruins\" of a clock face.  Yet what is watered grows; thus even an ancient ruins can initiate new life, as the unearthing of sculpture from an ancient Greece was seminal in issuing forth that springtime in Italy known as the Renaissance. This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour. With the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars. This notion of \"mutable reality\" is a familiar theme in my work, which seeks to explore the boundaries of realism and representation:  Time... History... Motion... Imagination... Reflectionï¿½",

    "work_description": "A 12-foot-long stylized rocket ship made of bronze and stainless steel sits on top of an 11-foot-high stainless steel base. The design of the rocket ship looks like a 1950s Hollywood movie space ship. The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things. The City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280",

The intention was to create an iconic sculpture acting as a gateway marker defining the entrance to the City of Vancouver. turn acts as an identifier of place, creating an image in the viewerï¿½s mind that connects them back to the site. The imagery and form for turn evolved from ideas about ï¿½drivingï¿½ and ï¿½fixingï¿½ in particular, with the final form of the sculpture column based upon the twist drill.

He didn't strike it rich and instead became a tax man and a steamboat pilot and later ran a saloon which is why he stands on a whiskey barrel. The Globe Saloon which stood on the site was reputedly built in 24 hours by the thirsty workers. (Vancouver Sun, April 7, 2001, H3) The nickname Gassy Jack came from the fact that he talked so much.

Cement and wood planks are interspersed with grass to create a walkway underneath the overhead track. The planks are reminiscent of a winding keyboard. The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments. Stepping on each board distinctly will cause steam to be forced through the barrels and out one side, creating a sound like a calliope on which you can play a tune. The sound harkens back to other times in relation to the contemporary sounds of the city which surround the piece.",

The granite shall be set in an east/west linear pattern, except for an inner oval directly under the artwork that will be cut and set in a specific pattern corresponding to the delineation of the elements of the piece.  The structure of the artwork is a series of 10\"x10\"x60' steel columns that are arranged in such a way as to delineate a scaled down relationship to the 5 elevator shafts in the core of the building. The 5 elevator cars are represented in their respective positions on the columns. An interface with the actual elevator system in the building will cause the artwork cars to glide up and down the columns in exact co-relation to the real cars, ie, if only elevator #2 is used, and it is taken to the 16th floor, the artwork will respond accordingly, while the remaining cars stay idle.  Next, in each car in the building, placed under the pumpkin coloured carpet, will be a multi-contact membrane switch that will pick up the various passengers' foot prints as they stand or walk in the car, and transmit them out to an LED matrix screen on the underside of each corresponding artwork car.  So, from a standing position on the plaza, an observer would be able to look up and see the movement and use of the inner workings of the building represented in a formal yet abstracted public realm.\" A.Storey, December 2001",

Here are a few comments from a listing of the mosaics and individual statements: \"Swirl of Creation by Shelly Schnee, family and friends: Each child involved got to pick an animal to represent their origins. Parker picked Ogopogo to represent his dad's upbringing in Vernon. Conner picked Dolphins to represent our feeling of coming from the ocean. Melida picked the Quetzal to represent her family's Latin heritage.  We translated our political words 'Community, Struggle, and Freedom into Spanish, as well as to tie the two heritages together.\"  \"Community by Nancy Sweedler and Allyson Prendergast:  My mosaic circle represents what dominates my physical space and heart.  It shows my house and the complex of houses that I live in, the greenery that surrounds us, the sky train that rushes through the neighbourhood (I live almost under it with my son Jake) and, central to everything, the people of all races and nationalities that I love and live amongst.  It is a pretty basic concept, but it means everything to me.\"",

The mosaics reflect the broad, multicultural community of Cedar Cottage and Trout Lake and highlight the Aboriginal community of East Vancouver. The theme of the work is Origins. One of the mosaics represents Dolcie and Vera Smith who grew up in the neighbourhood. It integrates photographs and fragments of china found in the back yard of the home. The three artists who coordinated the project did one mosaic - a montage of hands and tools representing  the kinds of work in the area.",

Inukshuks in the north are usually much smaller and the rocks are balanced on each other.  They act as sign posts or distance markers that can be seen on the flat horizon. Artist Kanak said,  \"By a lake an Inukshuk means lots of fish.\"  The figure is a \"reminder of the ingenuity of my people in addressing transportation and communications challenges prior to the introduction of modern technology.\" (sources: M.Farrow, V.Sun, April 24, 1985; V.Province, May 5, 1985)",

    "artist_statement": "It took nearly eight years for this monument to come into being. A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, \"The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance.\" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  \"The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.\"  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to \"all women who have been murdered by men\".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief. But despite the obstacles, \"Marker of Change\" was unveiled in Thornton Park on December 6th, 1997 exactly eight years after the 14 women were killed.",

The circle is situated close to the center of the park and makes reference to ancient stone circles. The space inside the circle is slightly domed and covered with grass. An alter-like podium stands just outside the circles and bears the name of the piece and an inscription.

The extension of the pavement above the waterï¿½s edge is meant to suggest this disappearance underground, to stir memory and history, while at the same time reinforcing the sense of the above ground space as a visually continuous promenade and plaza.  The pondï¿½s dominant feature, a circular granite sculpture sited in the center of the pond, is elevated above the grade of the paving so that a viewer (pedestrian or resident) can fully comprehend its form: a form that might suggest a flower, a wheel, a saw blade....This sculpture also has a spatial function to gather and hold energy as well as operating as a source of water for the pond. The three granite rings embedded in the concrete plaza reiterate the central well of the sculpture from which the water flows and activate the plaza plane. This plane is further activated by the stainless steel rings that echo both the shape of the pond ends as well as the wave movement of the water.  As the pedestrian moves into the space the sound of the falling water becomes more dominant till the extraneous sounds of the street are entirely absorbed offering respite and perhaps an opportunity for further engagement and reflection.",

The Parks Board pursued a second opportunity and a donor was found (Mary and Herb Auerbach).  The current Wind Swimmer was installed at Kits beach in 1996. The mechanism is specially engineered so that at winds of more than 55mph it turns sideways and slows down. (Guddrun Will, Vancouver Courier, May 19, 1996) Wind Swimmer was redesigned in 1999.",

The poodle is not associated with a particular culture, and can therefore be enjoyed by a wide range of people along the street and in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Untitled (Poodle) is intended as a curiosity that will bring attention to the sculpture as a marker or icon of time and place.

In itï¿½s last episode, the Time Top was slowing down over the ocean . . . And the artist has picked up the story line from there and is presenting this sculpture as ï¿½a relic of reality, building on the idea of an alternative reality which we each share with a broad diversity. ï¿½ A comic book describing the artistï¿½s creative and fabrication processes will be published to coincide with the opening event scheduled for early October 2006. After being fabricated out of silicon bronze by the Harman Foundry in Sechelt, BC, Time Top was submerged into the ocean water at Gibsons, BC for two years. While submerged, it was connected to an electrical power supply which delivered a low voltage charge to the bronze causing it to attract a deposition of seawater minerals on to itï¿½s surface forming a crust. This process is known as ï¿½Electro-deposition of minerals in seawaterï¿½ or accretion. When the accretion process was complete, the sculpture was fitted with a polycarbonate dome and now stands 13 feet tall and 10 feet wide. A series of granite cap stones, inscribed with images from the original comic strip, have been installed along the sea wall in front of the sculpture. The sculpture fabrication was completed after the artistï¿½s death in 2003 by a team led by Margaret Pethick, Jerryï¿½s wife, according to his fully documented drawings, specifications and nstructions.\" - press release, Maureen Smith, Concord Pacific, August 2006",

The design was chosen from over 70 submissions to a public call for designs.  It took 10 years to raise the funds. After a 2-year public consultation, the Park Board approved the sight at Sunset Beach. The Society also has a mandate to educate people about AIDS. http://www.aidsmemorial.ca/",

Both figures wear Salish blankets incorporating weaving designs and a salmon motif. On the reverse side, the male has traditional design elements and the female has a motif influenced by Salish berry basket designs.                                                                                            2) Grandparents and Grandchildren Honoured - On the upright poles located southwest of the path an intertwined braid of hair links the three female faces of the grandparents pole, illustrating the powerful matrilineal ancestry of the Coast Salish. The abstract design on the back represents the salmon, once so plentiful in the area. The grandchildren pole pays tribute to the importance of the family bond. On the reverse side, a carved herring design reflects the living culture in the area as it has been transformed through history.                                                                                              3) Salish Dancer and Killer Whale - Visible from the seawall and park drive north, the third portal articulates the evolution of Salish design. A Coast Salish Dancer shows a human figure holding a sea serpent rattle and above it, the Thunderbird, the most powerful of all spirits and a symbol of protection. On the opposite face of the Dancer, tree roots connect us to the land, sea and sky.  The Killer Whale upright depicts five whales, each with a raven fin and salmon pectoral, representing the close link between humans and orcas. The Salish believe that when great chiefs die, they become killer whales. The crossbeam is carved with a Salish textile motif.",

The 14ï¿½ high water-jet cut aluminum sculpture, powder coated in copper and silver paint, is a contemporary Coast Salish design depicting salmon and river grass, which are representative of the Coast Salish people, and the Musqueam people in particular, and the salmon, once found in abundance in the nearby Fraser River.",

When I was asked to create a sculptural proposal for the entrance to Stanley Park, it occurred to me that it might be interesting to return to this workï¿½and try to realize a large-scale version of one of these sculptures: to use the same very limited instrumental set with which anyone who has put together a toy glider would be familiar. The theme of flight seemed appropriate given the location too, for seaplanes are common sights at the entrance to the park.  And the park, of course, is a place where children and adults may very well play with glidersï¿½ Plus it would be something that would be interesting when glimpsed only briefly by passengers in vehicles moving at relatively high speed along West Georgia.  The title of the work is meant to evoke, in a slightly humorous wayï¿½that of a classical modernist public monument of a bygone period, elements of which the sculpture plays with.",

His piece for the Georgia Street entrance to Stanley Park, a spectacular 400-hectare evergreen oasis in the downtown peninsula, is a 35 foot abstract stainless steel sculpture that replicates a balsa wood toy glider set; abstractly assembled as a modern sculpture. The work includes an impression of the twisted blue elastic band that would be used to power the glider, a propeller that slowly turns in the wind and wheels that whimsically bob.",

    "artist_statement": "Riding high among the rooftops in Vancouver is an unusual sight that awaits the casual viewer looking upward from street to sky; a 58 inch-high bright copper sculpture of a historical-looking figure riding a lively horse with a ringleted mane, reading a book while sitting backwards. The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Grahamï¿½s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to ï¿½ponder on horsebackï¿½  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Grahamï¿½s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneerï¿½s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a ï¿½treasure islandï¿½, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artistï¿½s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that ï¿½the trip is the thingï¿½.

    "work_description": "Double Blind is a large-scale sculptural installation by Antonia Hirsch, commissioned for the atrium of the new Vancouver Community Collegeï¿½s Broadway Campus Phase One Expansion building. Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.  Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community Collegeï¿½s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ï¿½insightï¿½ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360ï¿½ view of the surrounding space.  Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.  This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installationï¿½s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely donï¿½t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.  On the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installationï¿½s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch.",

The Drop pays homage to the element of water and the un-tameable forces of nature which are omnipresent in Vancouver.  The slender, elongated sculpture balances as if a huge raindrop were on the verge of landing on the sea walk.  Although the sculpture takes a natural phenomenon as its starting point, it displays a technical perfection, artificially coloured to correspond to the sky and contrasting with the pale yellow mass of the mountain of sulphur visible on the horizon, waiting to be loaded into cargo ships.  The sculptureï¿½s angle and orientation create a visual dialogue with the architecture of the Convention Centre West, as well as with the bows of the gigantic cruise ships frequently docked nearby.  Like an abstract, radiant-blue shipï¿½s figurehead, it marks the interface between land and water, between nature and technology.",

My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.  The conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the placeï¿½the situationï¿½the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art.   Light is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life. Besides, light is a very changeable element: Actually lightï¿½daylight and artificial lightï¿½exists in endlessly different versions. And light is a very ephemeral element; that's why I like it.

It has particular historical significance as a former location of Vancouver City Hall (1889-1929) where mayors and councillors used the legal power of the City to enact and expand laws that negatively impacted Chinese residents.ï¿½Saltwater City Vancouver/______ï¿½ was developed by Wong as part of his year-long residency ï¿½_____/Occupying Chinatownï¿½ at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden (2018ï¿½2019) commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program.ï¿½Paulï¿½s ï¿½Saltwater City Vancouverï¿½ neon inspires conversations about the importance of understanding and appreciating both the tangible and intangible heritage assets when we celebrate the significance of Chinatown, its history, people and language in relation to the City,ï¿½ said Vincent Kwan, Executive Director, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden.The launch of Wongï¿½s residency in April 2018 coincided with the City of Vancouverï¿½s formal apology for historical discrimination against Chinese residents in Vancouver. During the residency the artist has translated and examined over 700 letters and artifacts from his late mother Suk-Fong Wong, using them as a source of inspiration to realize workshops, performances, and artworks in photography, video, and sculpture including this neon work. The letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition ï¿½_____ /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?ï¿½ at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in 2019, and provided an account of Chinaï¿½s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wongï¿½s family, offering a unique understanding of Chinaï¿½s transformation in the late-twentieth century.Saltwater City Vancouver/______ is a Public Art project commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program in partnership with Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden, and is supported by The Prospero Group and the Audain Art Foundation.",

The work is intended as a self-conscious reflection upon the idea of development and demonstrates a simple yet evocative response to the notion of progress and achievement. Much of my work deals with the semiotics of the built world. It tries to find a contingent position in between the idea of development and urbanism. The work is both a truism and a statement of desire.ï¿½",

The Birds reminds us of our past, but it aspires to challenge the future. It is my hope that the work stimulates understanding that will lead to a greater sense of shared responsibility and caring.",

Jeska Slater painted portraits of each of the youth artists that were working to complete a large-scale piece. The portraits and the youth's original work are displayed side by side. Thisproject meant to be a celebration- both of the youth themselves, their artisitic accomplishments and their commitment to their community.",

The steel fence, with its grids and rivets that delineate the eyes, mouths and fins of the whales and the salmon, represents a type of vessel similar to the ships that anchor at Port Metro Vancouverï¿½the destination of the majority of the trucks driving along the street below the artwork. The sculpture depicts two sets of stylized whales facing opposite directions with their tale flukes meeting in the centre. The whales pursue salmon cascading down the slope towards the North Shore mountains.",

The abstracted video feed, from a webcam incorporated into a public control panel at street level, reflects the street activity, animating the patio area.The animated display has a second function: triggered by a button on the control panel, the video feed becomes the starting-point for a computer animation of abstract figures which move, evolve and travel across the display. Many will recognize this particular procedurally-generated animation as the computer program known as Game Of Life, which unfolds frame-by-frame through a simple set of rules that determines whether each pixel lights up, stays lit, turns off, or stays off based on the number of its neighbours which are lit. The animation is intriguing because it creates patterns that appear intentional, and seem to relate to human activity.",

    "work_description": "SeeSawSeat is a public artwork by Germaine Koh that crosses a bus bench with a teeter-totter. Waiting for the bus is transformed from a passive pause into a modest social activity. Made of wood and metal and resembling the benches in Vancouver's bus shelters, the artwork is located in close proximity to an existing transit shelter with an integral bench making the visual references clear.A transit bench as teeter-totter creates a playful situation full of possibilities for interaction and negotiation. Uncomfortable when used by only one person, the artwork is best experienced with another person and thus becomes a tool for whimsical social exchange.SeeSawSeat is built with the fulcrum of the bench slighly to one side, so that when then bence is unoccupied, it drops to one side, a clear sign that it is not a fixed bench. The highest point of teh 8-foot-long bench is approximately 28\" above grade when fully tilted.SeeSawSeat was one of three public art projects developed through the Main Street Urban Transportation Showcase (UTS), a plan to encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and more energy efficient transportation practices by improving pedestrian and transit services along Main Street. As part of the Main Street UTS, an art plan was created which led to the commissioning of three public art projects to be installed in the Main Street corridor, including temporary artworks for three Main Street articulated trolley buses. Artists were selected by a panel consisting of three art professionals, and one representative each from Translink and City of Vancouver.This artwork is part of a transit and corridor improvement project and funding partnership between Translink, the City of Vancouver and the Federal Government",

    "artist_statement": "The artwork responds to the architectural and cultural context of the VPL_s new n___ca_ _mat ct Strathcona Branch Library. It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of ï¿½Head in the Holeï¿½ photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, n___ca_ _mat ct, loosely translates as ï¿½we are oneï¿½ in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as ï¿½oneï¿½ across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of _Head in hole_ photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it. It is a sculptural activation of the imaginative process involved in reading. The holes provide the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror as the animal from a distance, or they invite you to peer inside.",

    "artist_statement": "Underneath Main and Terminal and extending back towards present-day Clark Drive existed a biologically rich lagoon and marsh area that was used by the Tsleil-Waututh, Skwxwï¿½7mesh (Squamish) and x_m__k__y__m (Musqueam) Nations since time immemorial. The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxwï¿½u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces. I am grateful for their generosity of time and guidance.",

    "artist_statement": "Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely a decoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouverï¿½s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilionï¿½s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvious something else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure? Substation Pavilionï¿½s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of ï¿½reclaimingï¿½ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them, creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus that contains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once a year with its short-lived mushroom heads. It is a constantly shifting and ever-present narrative running just below the surface of the city. Cedric Bomford October, 2014",

From muralist Take 5: ï¿½It means a good feeling that you carry in your heart, written in the language of the people that have lived here a long, long time.ï¿½    From lead artist researcher Cease Wyss: ï¿½The Skwxwu7mesh quote used in this work ï¿½ha7lh en skwalwenï¿½ which translates as ï¿½my heart feels goodï¿½ is a reminder that the First Languages, like the First Peoples, continue to thrive and live here. The Salmon represent resilience, as well as hope for sustainability. The Woman and the Child represent what we are holding onto, and what we are reaching for: hope and life. The visual stories represented in this mural weave themselves into the many culturally diverse groups of neighbors and what we all share in our daily lives, and a hope for those who view it daily to be lifted up during their work at the garden or their daily commute, or even just their walk in the hood.ï¿½",

Through a process of inquiry and research, the artists draw heavily on individual and shared narratives within the founding DTES cultural groups including the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and Musqueam Nations, and African, Chinese, Japanese and European settlers.  In addition to a large public mural on Hastings Street, Soul Gardens created a dynamic online interface inviting individuals to share recipes, stories, photos and other information about how food played a role in shaping their experience of Vancouver.",

Along with the intuitive arrangements of the crosses, which create a contrast to the rigid grid of the building, these organic swarms of crosses seek to visually erode the architecture making it more porous, almost formless, allowing for a gentler interface with its surroundings.Similar to ambient music, with an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over structure and rhythm, ï¿½RGBï¿½ seeks to reflect the diversity and inclusiveness of the Central Presbyterian Church and the surrounding West End community.",

The artwork title ï¿½RGBï¿½ refers to the additive model of reproducing colours with light (red, green, and blue). The three colours can also be seen to symbolize the Trinity. A fritted glass pattern comprised of over 1,000 crosses on each large panel of glass are repeated across the windows of the church facility. Nine different intuitive arrangements of crosses, three arrangements for each of the three colours, create an overall, organic, swarming pattern. The architecture appears porous as light passes through the windows and the shadows of the crosses spill across the interior surfaces.",

I chose this spot because to me it connects indigenous peoplesï¿½ voices and understandings to the public realm of knowledge, understanding, and education. I took special care to include many traditional elements of north-west coast and prairie cultures, and represent many kinds of faces of indigenous women.\"",

The subject of the work is a group of women who practice ï¿½squareï¿½ or ï¿½plazaï¿½ dancing in the neighbourhood. The tradition has roots in both ancient and modern Chinese history, and is a popular exercise routine performed to music in squares, plazas and parks around the world. These local performances have been a consistent scene in the otherwise rapidly changing community of Cedar Cottage. The sessions occur most mornings in the tennis courts at Brewers Park, at the Cedar Cottage Community House, or other nearby locations. The sculpture depicts one of these dancers, Koco, in six poses, each pose distinct but merging into one another, atop a square base. The sculpture was produced using 3D scanning and printing technology to capture the dancer and her movements before the final bronze form.",

They are not resolved in the way architecture requires, but instead hover with a sense of openness. Scaled up and clustered in colourful constellations, their pressence will heighten the dramatic possibilities of the site while making and activating the space below them. The lanterns follow a geometric design with their component shape being found as the \"leaf\" in the 1925 abstract trees of French sculptors Jan and Joel Martel.",

The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre. Also portrayed on this layer is the Vancouver Museum and Pacific Space Centre.The third layer of carved logs portrays a view north across English Bay to Stanley Park, Vancouver's West End, and the North Shore mountains - a scene which is typical from almost any viewpoint in the Kitsilano area.The sign was designed by Kitsilano resident Jim Kostyniuk and carved by BC artist Pete Ryan. The sign is an initiative of the Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce. (Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce, Dedication of the Welcome to Kitsilano Sign and Sculpture, June 20, 1998)",

The inside viewer (hospital community or patients and staff?) is/are able to examine objects in detail over a 35 foot, colour-changing walkway mural, while the public art viewer sees an expanded version as colour spectrums spanning up five floors.Culled from her collection of jewel-toned glass objects and augmented by flea market finds and borrowed treasures, this giant-sized still life creates a spectrum of colour that is projected into the building in the afternoon and glows at night in a building-sized lightbox. Like large photographic slides, the transparent panels are mounted to a series of glass walkways that make up one wall of the internal atrium. The murals transform the hallways with the changing light, allowing inside viewers to experience a ï¿½colour walkï¿½ as the sun projects the art into the building and onto the light colored floor.",

Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of a plant and are responsible for growth.The recent transformation of the Cambie corridor from single-family homes to higher density development inspired us to examine the idea of growth. The proximity of Queen Elizabeth Park focused this examination to expression of plant forms.The metaphor of undifferentiated cells allowing complex growth can be exended to the human and social spheres and to the opportunities presented by the dramatic change in the fabric of this neighbourhood.Two sides of the bronze sculpture are smooth planar sections terminating at the top in a point, while the third side is a rough, cast surface designed to retain an ancient-looking patina. The smooth surfaces present a calm and elegant facade to the viewer while the third side is seasoned with bright streaks of turquoise, purple and green sharing the warm brown surface.The viewer is able to engage in the two every different surfaces of the monolith in an intimage way due to scale.",

There has always been a deep appreciation of those who came before me tending to the land in such a way that even now natural beauty is a defining feature in a teeming city. The ancestors and spirit that sits deep in the land are always very apparent to me. I wanted this art then to reflect this and also to be fantastical ï¿½ to engage both the land and the imagination.I used big colours that match dusk and dawn, I brought in highlights of the old meeting the new (the cherry blossoms versus the cedar), I focused on iconic landscapes within the geography that is Vancouver.  I depicted animals that we share space with everyday and perhaps do not see.  If you look close, you can identify them. I wanted to explore our connections with ancestors and spirit and life.\"",

Not limited to only Chinese-speaking patrons, CCC is a safe space where those who love Chinese culture can share their interests and where young people or native-born Chinese can explore their roots. It is important to emphasize that Chinatown is not only for Chinese or tourists but a space that welcomes everyone to celebrate the beauty of diversity.When one generation passes their secret recipes or tell their life stories to the next generation, it is like passing down little pieces of cultural heritage. I hope the mural introduces a slice of Chinatownï¿½s multicultural and intergenerational community in a fun and optimistic way.",

The eight immortals, in the context of migration, can be seen as representations and celebrations of diversity in all the individuals that make up the history of Vancouverï¿½s Chinatown: those who have overcome difficulties, and those who have made contributions tothis community, each in their own way.We hope the mural, through its exploration of Chinese mythology in a local context, can act as a catalyst to re-imagine Vancouverï¿½sChinatown, its history, and its people as the work re-interprets a traditional story in celebration of the real stories of the community members who shaped this neighbourhood. We also hope the depiction of a classic legend can spark conversations between generations, and provide an opportunity to bridge cultures.____________________________________________________________ï¿½_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",

    "artists_names": "Erwin Wurm",
    "artist_statement": "\"Inspired by Henry David Thoreauï¿½s essay ï¿½Civil Disobedienceï¿½ (1849), Wurmï¿½s Big Disobedience, (2016) makes reference to an often explored theme: political and social correctness. Related in its use of the human form and apparel, Half Big Suit (2016) stems from an earlier series, Cut, that investigates the fragmented body. Fixed in an awkward position, with one leg extended in the air, the static sculpture conveys a sense of distress experienced while undergoing a durational performance or holding a lengthy pose. In their focus on the body and its motions, these works relateto Wurmï¿½s famous One Minute Sculptures series (XXXX), in which viewers enact simple yet absurd poses for one minute at a time.The relationship between the organic transformation of the body through biological factors and the intentional moulding of objects in Wurmï¿½s work is illustrated in his architectural structure, Flat Iron (2016). Here the artistï¿½s distorted recreation of New Yorkï¿½s iconic Flatiron Building is demonstrated in a melting structure, demonstrating further how the manipulation of volume, scale, form and materiality, can signal transformation in both human and non-human form.Inspired by Wurmï¿½s performative practice, the Gallery invited Mike Bourscheid, an artist who works between Luxembourg and Vancouver, to develop a series of performative interventions at Offsite: Erwin Wurm.\" - Vancouver Art Gallery",

    "artist_statement": "In the grand scheme of Vancouverï¿½s heritage, the neon period from 1925 to 1960 is perhaps the cityï¿½s most heralded example of its transition from gloomy sawmill town to vibrant metropolis. At the peak of this glowing epoch there were thousands of electrified gas filled glass tubes in the Terminal Cityï¿½s neon jungle. A big hiccup in this brightlights-big-city story came with the blackouts of WWII when civil defence restrictions lead to a new category of no neon outdoor advertising known as ï¿½Spectaculars.ï¿½When McGavinï¿½s Bakery approached Neon Products for an animated neon of Mother Hubbardï¿½s bread, a ï¿½Spectacularï¿½ was suggested instead. A hand of enormous proportions was proposed, roughly the same size as the Statue of Libertyï¿½s, but instead of grasping the eternal flame of freedom, Mother Hubbardï¿½s digits would raise on high a leviathan loaf of liberty bread! Genius! McGavinï¿½s, a big supporter of Victory Bonds, approved.Ironically, work on the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf didnï¿½t begin until after blackout restrictions had been lifted at the end of the war. Progress slowed when McGavinï¿½s roof required fortification supporting the added weight. Then the ï¿½Spectacularï¿½ installers were unavailable, preoccupied by a Log Cabin Cookies billboard featuring a real log cabin with smoking chimney and Mom inside whipping up maple creams. Finally in September 1948, the ï¿½Spectacularï¿½ crew convened on the roof of McGavinï¿½s and over the next four months assembled the sheet metal loaf and concrete mixed with vermiculite hand, and a cuff hiding the steel bridgework. The finished Giant Hand &amp; Loaf stood atop McGavinï¿½s bakery from 1949 through 1973.When Henri Robideau photographed the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf in February 1973, its cuff had blown away in a wind storm and one of its fingers had rotted off. This image became the first in his life-long photographic study of humanityï¿½s attraction to bigness, a new science he called Gianthropology. He conducted Gianthropological Digs along the Pacific cordillera throughout the 1970ï¿½s, culminating in the 1980 exhibition Giant Things, featuring the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf as its signature image. Expanding on that huge success he launched the Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, portaging around Canada in the 1980ï¿½s, photographing the monumental in the form of panoramic images.",

The name is a pun on the nature of neon, as literally light made from gas.  The design of the sign was inspired by the title card for the 1940 film Gaslight. With the film&rsquo;s success, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; was adopted in psychology to refer to a form of abuse in which the victim is covertly manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception, judgement, and eventually their sanity. More recently this term has been used to describe the manipulation of an entire society through misinformation and destabilizing the concept of truth.   In the current context fractured by a global public health pandemic, the inequalities of late capitalism, the violence of systemic racism, and a looming catastrophic climate crisis, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; has re-emerged as a powerful signifier and imminent warning of the gap between perception and reality.",

The most opportune time to accomplish this is before entering the Library - confronting the viewer by having them walk through the piece - and perhaps encouraging them to leave their previous perceptions at the door. The format in presenting the concept is another Leonardo da Vinci exercise - a geometric discovery of form, mathematics and order. Our interpretation of the exercise challenges the viewer's perceptions: first, by engaging the individual in a visual puzzle that defines the various elements of the geometry in a manner that also juggles their perceptions; and secondly, by making visual references to the cosmos that will take the viewer beyond the physical piece to consider the mysteries of the mind, universe, and of course, the search for truth. In locating the piece at, and as the entrance, it emphasizes Public Art as a functioning componenet of life and architecture - the concept challenging one's thought process and the physical statement aiding in the flow and function of the ordered architecture.",

I wanted some image capable of appealing to the imagination of those who would use the lobby every day so that they would not tire of it and therefore become oblivious to it. What better than a great \" primavera \" for Spring to cheer the spirit? And what more impressive than a large sculptural relief in full colour? And what more poetically exuberant as a permanent symbol than two splendid butterflies breaking from the white cocoon of Spring - the one on the left an abstraction of pieces coming together to form the insect and the one on the right a full-fledged realization? It is hoped that once the mind is focussed in this direction a certain transformational process is suggested and with it certain mythological overtones might unfold. The cocoon may then become the violet and white mythic egg from which Spring is born. The symbolic bird and flowers now become the guardians of this ritual birth of new life, this PRIMAVERA.",

Sparrow creates traditional weavings and indicated that she was interested in working on the community art piece. Out of community consultations and workshops, a mural was created with colours and patterns drawn from Musqueam visual traditions. Many community members participated in painting the school of salmon along the south wall near the main entrance and a community salmon barbecue was held to celebrate its completion. - Parks Board web site",

Her weavings incorporate traditional weaving designs that reflect the Coast Salish (Musqueam) Culture, such as Salish Vï¿½s and Waves.Krista Point created two of these beautiful weavings (number 3 and 4 from the left, if facing the display case along Granville Street).

Vancouver refocused the national celebration on its indigenous peoples and First Nations, who long precede confederation, and whose resurgence will continue long past the anniversary--hence \"150+\".The public art program issued a call for murals in January 2017. The six successful applicant teams were reviewed and chosen by a selection panel of Indigenous artists and art professionals.The projects were realized throughout the city centre, including projects at the central library, Queen Elizabeth Theatre and its plaza, the headhouse of a Canada Line station, a laneway on the Downtown Eastside, and the lot where the Kanata Fest and the Drum Is Calling Festival were held.Works variously drew from Coast Salish, formline, and Woodland School forms, presented portraits mixing contemporary and traditional clothing and regalia, and collaged photographic images into abstracted compositions.Commissioned in the spirit of Reconcilation, the project served to increase Indigenous visibility on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations now known as Vancouver.",

Legends have been thought about time immemorial and passed on from generation to generation. They are contemporary tales because the story is always changing. An Eagleï¿½s spirit, or the spirit of a bear is not always the same thing. Different characteristics and different places mean different things. Kelly and I have created a contemporary design that demonstrates the way nature flows together. In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots. Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden. Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again. The broken circle of each design element refers to fragmented spindle whorl artifacts and the separations we see between these elements. Only when we see the whole picture together will the circle be complete. Our home is to inspire people to look closer in order to understand the subtleties and multitude of factors involved in our world.",

Seeming to float in the vaulted space, the new artwork is viewable from multiple vantage pointsï¿½from below on floor eight and from above and the sides on floor nine.The sculpture connects to the foreshores of the region: the boats used for trade, fishing, and connecting communities on these lands and waters since before recorded history, and the continuing significance of boats and travel to the histories, myths, and narratives told in cultures across the world.",

This public artwork is inspired by Old Faithful and other natural water spouts arising from geological pressures under the earthï¿½s surface.   A natural geyser is a spectacle that brings attention to what is going on below the surface of things. As a public monument, Geyser for Hillcrest Park replicates this sense of wonder and acts as a spontaneous reminder of underlying forces at work on the site. It is a civic ï¿½natural wonderï¿½ that makes the green initiatives of the building apparent for all to see. It is not a fountain that operates with a recycling pump. The Geyser acts according to the rhythms and needs of the community, as evidenced by the levels and flow of water through the site. The geyser spray is around 15 feet in height. The duration of the spray is determined by the amount of water needed to fill the tank. The run-off from the Geyser is connected to the grey water cistern in the Hillcrest facility. This cistern is used for all the buildingï¿½s non-potable water needs, including flushing toilets and irrigation throughout the park grounds. The cistern is fed by collected rainwater from the roof and some grey water from underground sources. However, when the water in the cistern is low, it draws on the cityï¿½s drinkable water supply. This is where the Geyser comes in. It is incorporated into this water ï¿½loop\" so that clean potable water needed to top up the cistern will first be propelled out through the Geyser and then flow back to the cistern as grey water.",

This abstract pattern of stripes inevitably produces a decorative effect, one with an ambiguous relation to the pattern's function as a marker and visualization tool. The work points to the potential and problems of such tools. The scale of the engineering of False Creek and the Cambie bridge, along with the scale of potential future environmental change, are made visually and physically palpable, yet the experience takes on an aesthetic related to philosophical concepts of the sublime.",

Functioning as a sign on the building, the letters are rendered in a font designed by the artists which references the motif of a formal trellis structure employing trompe l'oeil techniques to create illusory depth and space. The spacing between the words in the phrase is based on a section of a Fibonacci sequence - reinforcing notions of the ideal, perfection and pragmatism which Voltaire explored so richly in Candide.",

The public art is part of the Cityï¿½s ongoing commitment to reconciliation and strengthening of relations between Indigenous communities and Vancouverites.The murals, banners and transparencies were commissioned as part of the City of Vancouver's commemoration of the sesquicentennial of Canada's confederation. Vancouver refocused the national celebration on its indigenous peoples and First Nations, who long precede confederation, and whose resurgence will continue long past the anniversary--hence \"150+\".The public art program issued a call for murals in January 2017. The six successful applicant teams were reviewed and chosen by a selection panel of Indigenous artists and art professionals.The projects were realized throughout the city centre, including projects at the central library, Queen Elizabeth Theatre and its plaza, the headhouse of a Canada Line station, a laneway on the Downtown Eastside, and the lot where the Kanata Fest and the Drum Is Calling Festival were held.Works variously drew from Coast Salish, formline, and Woodland School forms, presented portraits mixing contemporary and traditional clothing and regalia, and collaged photographic images into abstracted compositions.Commissioned in the spirit of Reconcilation, the project served to increase Indigenous visibility on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations now known as Vancouver.",

There was no official theme or requirements except material specifications, I.e., frost-proof tile, type of glue, and spacing of tiles for grout allowance during installation.

There are 3 separate sections of mosaic tile: the largest is approx. 80' long and varies in width and shape, the other two sections are approx. 10' long and 2 to 2.5' wide. The mosaics, set on a concrete base, are flush with the ground and flat across the surface, symbolically representing the surface of water. The park also includes a herb garden with a mosaic border designed by Glen Andersen and Marina Szijarto and wooden benches and a basalt pillar play area designed by Sarah White.",

The elliptical roof of each pavilion is supported by two walls made of stainless steel with cutout silhouettes of  industrial and natural forms. A second component of Lookout is a perimeter railing with cantilevered glass panels. The panels are inscribed with sandblasted words, written especially for this site in consultation with poet Robin Blaser. Midway between the two pavilions, the cut-out images are cast into the concrete walkway. As well, the artists have placed 13 simple bronze chairs throughout the site. The art work has an accompanying website at: http://www.lookoutsculpture.com/",
