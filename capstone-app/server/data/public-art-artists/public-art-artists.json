In 1977 he completed his most substantial work of approximately 40x80 sq. ft. at the Grand Theatre in Quebec City.  In one corner of the mural he used a line from Quebec poet Claude Peloquin, translated, \"Aren't you fed up with dying, you fools?

Supporters of the artist organized a demonstration 1800 strong that included sculptor Armand Vaillancourt who wore a suit of armor and rode a horse on stage, waving banners and demanding freedom of expression. The architect and the government supported the artist's rights. (Star Weekly, Sept.4, 1971) Bonet also made two aluminium doors encrusted with glass for King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the vault \"Our Lady of the Sky\" at the Kennedy Airport in NY.

(Traditionally, these dances and rituals were performed on the first Monday after 12th night, but as most of us are at work on that day - unlike olden times! - we've moved the event one day earlier.) For Molly dancing, the men, dressed in old farmers clothes and with blackened faces, typically carry a plough from door-to-door, performing a strange, stamping dance lead by the \"head\" couple - the King and the Molly (a \"man-woman\"). The photo to the right was taken in 1992 during our inaugural Molly dance-out, an event which has now become a regular, annual event. The dances, which come from the villages of Girton and Comberton near Cambridge, are based on Feast Dances - communal social dances from the 19th century. Also on Plough Sunday, we perform the \"WOOING\" MUMMERS PLAY from Bassingham. Here are some pictures of the VMM \"in action\" on Plough Sunday, January 2003 and Plough Sunday, January 2005.

Marthe, Saskatchewan.  He attended the University of Manitoba (BFA 1966) and Pennsylvania State University (MFA 1968). He was at the University of Saskatchewan, Regina from 1968 \u2013 1974 and visiting lecturer at the University of California at Davis in 1980-1981. Joe Fafard is a distinguished full-time artist and sculptor who currently resides on an acreage near Lumsden, Saskatchewan.    \r\n\r\nMr. Fafard is one of Canada\u2019s leading professional visual artists and has exhibitions of a wide variety of work in galleries and museums across the country and around the world, including the United States, Great Britain, France and Japan.  He is widely recognized as being at the forefront of his art, and his outstanding contributions to the arts have significantly raised the profile of both Saskatchewan and Canada on the national stage. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981; awarded the Architectural Institute of Canada Allied Arts Award in 1987; received an honorary Degree from the University of Regina in 1989, and from the University of Manitoba in 2007; received the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2002; received the National Prix Montfort in 2003; received the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s Saskatchewan Centennial Medal for the Arts in 2005;  was named CTV Citizen of the Year in 2006; and the Saskatchewan Arts Board Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.  Joe Fafard will also be receiving his 3rd honorary Doctorat degree from the University of Saskatchewan in June of 2012.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the pinnacle of his career was the touring Retrospective exhibition, hosted by 6 different venues, from September 2007 through September 2009, jointly organized by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and the Mackenzie Art Gallery in Regina.  However,  most recently, Joe Fafard was chosen to be honored by Canada Post in their \u201cArt Canada\u201d series of postage stamps, released February 23, 2012.  Three of his artworks are featured on the domestic Canadian stamps, the USA stamps and the International stamps.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970\u2019s, much of his sculpture used clay as a medium.  In 1985, he shifted to bronze as his chief sculptural medium, successfully establishing a foundry in Pense.  \r\nHis insight and humor characterize his portraits of neighbors, farm animals, wildlife, and famous artists that he came to respect as he learned his craft.  His work in bronze is displayed across Canada and his \u201ccows\u201d have become one of his trademarks.  Some say that Joe Fafard adds a sense of humor to his depiction of the everyday through his artwork; Joe says that he never really took it out...\r\n\r\nQuote from Joe: \"I can't put a finger on what compels me to make these things, but I keep doing it anyway.  Well, it is a good way to live and make a living.  I'm quite happy about it!\""}, "record_timestamp": "2021-03-15T03:31:49.321-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art-artists", "recordid": "137d35552485ccbb36aa60b81528bd9499f8d1c9", "fields": {"firstname": "Jerry", "lastname": "Pethick", "artistid": 272, "artisturl": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=272", "country": "Canada", "biography": "Pethick attended the Royal College of Art in London, England, and has lived on Hornby Island for many years.

He currently lives and works in Vancouver, British Columbia. Working mainly in sculpture and installation, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing diaspora of Cuba.  Politically and socially charged, Yero\u2019s work contends with issues of national identity and plays with the boundaries of kitsch and high art, frequently comprising small-scale ceramic objects that reference pop art and the tourist souvenir.  Metaphors of death and water are prevalent throughout Yero\u2019s practice. Through large-scale installations, he has explored the effect of the multiple on the bodily experience of the viewer. Most recently he has investigated the effects of light on the eye through his sculptural light installation Passage, which will be presented at Access Gallery as part of the public art project Bright Light, commissioned by the City of Vancouver.\r\n\r\nSolo exhibitions of Yero\u2019s work include: Loop galeria 23 y 12, Havana, Cuba (2008); Hereafter, Xeno Gallery, Dadabase, Vancouver, BC (2003); Landmark, Belkin Satellite Vancouver, BC (2002); Transplant, Grunt Gallery, Vancouver, BC (2002).

In 1968, Gathie Falk was introduced to performance art through workshops given by American dancer Deborah Hay. By 1976, she had created fifteen meticulous performances, as well as many of her signature sculptural works including Home Environment, Herd, Veneration of the White Collar Worker, Single Men\u2019s Shoes, and the Fruit Piles.After many years of being a sculptor and performance artist, Falk returned to painting for nearly two decades, producing the renowned exhibitions Pieces of Water, Night Skies, and Cement. Since the 1990s, she has skillfully alternated between two- and three-dimensional work, creating her most significant papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and bronze works, and continuing her evocative exploration of paint.In addition to over 50 solo exhibitions, Gathie Falk has received many awards, including the Gershon Iskowitz Prize (1990), Order of Canada (1997), Order of British Columbia (2002), Governor General\u2019s Award in Visual and Media Arts (2003), Viva Award for Lifetime Achievement (2012), and the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts (2013).Falk has been the subject of two retrospective exhibitions at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1985 and 2000 (traveling to the National Gallery of Canada, Norman Mackenzie Art Gallery, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, and Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts de Montr\u00e9al).

His lifelong involvement in photography incorporates more than fifty years of teaching, professional production for many of Canada\u2019s leading artists and personal art creation incorporating photographic imagery and handwritten narrative text.Born 1946 in Bristol, Connecticut, he grew up in New England, North Carolina and California, where his teen years were spent in the booming post WWII suburbs of San Diego county. In university he studied chemistry at San Diego State College for two years but dropped out and moved in 1966 to the Bay Area, pursuing a life in the arts. He trained as a commercial photographer at Laney College in Oakland, before emigrating to Vancouver in 1970 as a refugee from the violence of America and as the fulfillment of a promise to his grandfather to someday return to the land of his ancestors.His first Canadian job as photo-technician for the Vancouver Public Library Historical Photograph Section, provided an immersion into Vancouver\u2019s visual history and introduced him to the work of photographer Mattie Gunterman. In 1976 he left the world of archives and researched Mattie Gunterman\u2019s life, producing an exhibition of her work that toured 26 venues and led to the 1995 publication of her historical biography, Flapjacks &amp; Photographs.In 1980 he launched a decade-long project The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, crisscrossing Canada in search of monumental human activity and the true meaning of Canada. After producing a series of sixty large scale black and white panoramic photographs he moved to Montreal in 1987 to work on the eastern side of the Survey. On July 14, his second day in Montreal, his panoramas were destroyed in a flood. His lost work was later celebrated in the publication Canada\u2019s Gigantic! Four years in Montreal came to an end with attending the events at Oka, followed by a trip to Japan he\u2019d been putting off since he was 9. The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey went largely unfinished after amassing more than 1500 panoramas, but out of it came 500 Fun Years a narrative on Colonialism done for the 1992 500th anniversary of resistance.In 1991 he moved back to Vancouver working for Green Peace photographer Robert Keziere out of Jack Shadbolt\u2019s old studio on Cambie Street providing photographic services and productions for Canada\u2019s leading artists, galleries and publications. He also taught photography at Emily Carr College of Art as a sessional for the next 25 years. For the past thirty years his practice has been in the form of multi panel photographic montages with holographic text. Sometimes this work is an introspective reflection on the ironic tragedy of human existence, as is the case with the two series The Crossroads Of Life and Acts Of God. Other times history and politics provide the narrative as in the millennial snapshot, Four Directions of the Okanagan, and most recently the anecdotal account of 40 years of Vancouver development, Eraser Street.Henri Robideau\u2019s photography has been exhibited and collected both in Canada and internationally. He lives and works in Vancouver respectfully on the unceded ancestral territory of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Peoples."}, "record_timestamp": "2021-03-15T03:31:49.321-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art-artists", "recordid": "cc2e08088f10414761f6c58c8e7c10811b79786f", "fields": {"website": "https://www.laurielandry.com", "photo": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=648&ImageId=1796", "firstname": "Laurie M", "lastname": "Landry", "artistid": 648, "artisturl": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=648", "country": "Canada", "biography": "Laurie M Landry attended Wells\u2019 Island Mountain School for the Arts in the late 1970s, and completed the Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design\u2019s Fine Arts Techniques program in 2008.
